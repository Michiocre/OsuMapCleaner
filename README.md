# OsuMapCleaner
A simple c# console application that gets rid of files i dont need


I started this when my PC ran out of storage space and i realised how much Osu uses.
Since i always play with background dim 100%, no video or storyboard i thought i could get rid of those.
The videos alone cleared up a lot of space, but i thought to myself how far i could take this.

So i compiled a list of all the files i wanted to keep.
  .osu      - else you wont have any beatmaps
  .mp3      - you could technically still play but thats i like them
  .jpg/png  - well not all of them only the backgrounds because i like the preview while browsing maps
  
But thats all
So im gonna delete all the videos, storyboard elements, custom skins and hitsounds

Later i realised i also had to watch out for some rouge .ogg and .jpeg files
